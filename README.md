### Description
A website prototype designed for the following prompt (abridged): 
>A new co-working startup is about to open in town. They've secured a space, remodeled it, and are opening in the next few months. But they still need a website!

>"We want our online presence to mirror our in-person presence, to attract people that would really enjoy working in our environment."

>"I also think it's really important convey our unique personality. It's what sets us apart from the 'big guys' in the coworking field. You know, places like WeWork and TechSpace. We think we're more funky, more local, less corporate, and a little more fun. we'd also love to see artists, daytraders, writers, counselors, more traditional business people--you know, anyone and everyone--in our space."
